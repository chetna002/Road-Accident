Road Accident Analysis 
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of road accidents across "Million Plus Cities," leveraging Python and data visualization tools to uncover key insights and propose actionable recommendations for enhancing road safety.

Key Highlights
Data Analysis and Visualization:

Conducted an in-depth study of accident data, focusing on patterns and trends in incidents.
Utilized bar plots, pie charts, and pivot tables to create interactive and intuitive visualizations for stakeholders.
Insights:

Identified Chennai, Delhi, and Jabalpur as cities with the highest reported accidents, with incident counts of 78,459, 72,526, and 57,715 respectively.
Highlighted primary causes, including road infrastructure features, traffic violations, and adverse weather conditions.
Recommendations:

Targeted Safety Campaigns: Addressing specific accident-prone zones and behaviors.
Infrastructure Upgrades: Improving road designs, traffic signal systems, and pedestrian facilities.
Enhanced Traffic Enforcement: Implementing stricter measures to reduce violations.
Weather-Related Protocols: Developing contingency plans for adverse weather conditions to mitigate risks.
